# EGA V9 --- Execution Governance AI

## Deterministic Runtime Governance for Autonomous AI Workflows

> **Official Replication Guide for the EGA V9 paper**

EGA V9 is an execution-governance framework for deterministic replay,
provenance-aware verification, trust-state evaluation, and fail-closed
containment in autonomous AI workflows.

This README serves as the official replication guide accompanying the
EGA V9 paper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Are You Facing These Problems?

☐ AI agent tool calls cannot be verified.

☐ Agent execution cannot be replayed.

☐ State corruption is difficult to diagnose.

☐ Workflow failures are hard to reproduce.

☐ Prompt injection leaves little audit evidence.

☐ Multi-agent execution becomes a black box.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. EGA V9 Solves These Problems

✓ Replay Verification

✓ Runtime Governance

✓ Trust-State Evaluation

✓ Fail-Closed Containment

✓ Execution Provenance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Works With

✓ LangChain + EGA V9

✓ OpenAI Agents SDK + EGA V9

✓ CrewAI + EGA V9

✓ AutoGen + EGA V9

✓ MCP Tool Server + EGA V9

> **Note;**
>
> **EGA V9 complements your existing agent framework—it does not replace it.**
>
> Keep your orchestration logic, prompts, and tool definitions.
> EGA adds deterministic runtime verification underneath.

## 5. Expected Output

A verified workflow confirms deterministic replay, preserves workflow integrity, and allows execution without containment. When the replay path matches the original execution, EGA confirms workflow integrity, keeps the trust state at **T1**, and allows execution without containment.

```json
{
  "status": "verified",
  "replayConsistency": true,
  "trustState": "T1",
  "containmentRequired": false,
  "executionAllowed": true
}
```

Field | Meaning
------|--------
`status` | Overall verification result.
`replayConsistency` | Confirms that replay reproduced the identical execution path.
`trustState` | Current runtime trust level (`T1` = verified).
`containmentRequired` | Indicates whether fail-closed containment is required.
`executionAllowed` | Whether the workflow is permitted to continue.
A verified workflow returns deterministic execution results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Reproducing the Paper

Regenerate the benchmark artifacts and verify that the repository reproduces the deterministic results reported in the EGA V9 paper.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Test

```bash
npm test
```

### Benchmark

```bash
npm run table4:build
```

### Publication Verification

```bash
npm run stage-c:gate
npm run stage-d:gate
npm run release:all-gates
```

Successful execution regenerates the publication artifacts, validates repository consistency, and confirms that the benchmark results remain reproducible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Publication Verification


Validate the complete publication pipeline by running each release gate in sequence.

### Stage A — Repository Validation

```bash
npm run release:gate
```

### Stage B — Build Validation

```bash
npm run stage-b:gate
```

### Stage C — Documentation Validation

```bash
npm run stage-c:gate
```

### Stage D — Benchmark Validation

```bash
npm run stage-d:gate
```

### Stage E — Publication Validation

```bash
npm run stage-e:gate
```

### Live Publication Verification

After all public artifacts (GitHub, npm, Vercel, paper, and documentation) are published, run the live consistency check.

```bash
npm run stage-e:live
```

Successful completion confirms that the repository, benchmark artifacts, documentation, and public publication assets are internally consistent and ready for release.

## 12. Roadmap

Current development:

-   Complete README replication guide
-   Finalize SDK
-   Finalize benchmark reproducibility
-   Finalize Stage E
-   Release v1.0.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Release Integrity Principle

> Do not trust a published result merely because it appears in a paper.
> Reproduce the benchmark, regenerate the publication artifact, and
> verify the release gates.
